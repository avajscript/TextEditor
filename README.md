# TextEditor

 JavaFX Text Editor that is still in the process of being developed. It uses custom functionality for all of the features, such as typing text, creating lines, and drawing/moving the line cursor on the screen.

 It enables you to create text documents with custom styling, such as different font sizes, font colors, alignment and more with a friendly user interface.

 I'll post more updates and add a download link when it is finished 😊
